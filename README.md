Tic Tac Toe is one of the few games that transcends cultures and continents, it is easily understood and cost nothing to play.

## The rule of the game

### Game Play

### Condition for a win

A player wins when all fields in a column are taken by the player.
A player wins when all fields in a row are taken by the player.
A player wins when all fields in a diagonal are taken by the player.

## Basic Tic Tac Toe

We are going old school.

Here we implement a console based version of Tic Tac Toe that allows two human players to play the game on a 3 x 3 board.

It's really simple... The first player will be the X, the second player will be the O. You keep playing the game until there is a winner, a draw, or someone gives up.
