You need to be able to read the code on an IDE that can compile C# (i.e. Rider). The game is played on the terminal.

## Coding principles used:
- TDD (Test driven development)
- Good testing code coverage
- Test doubles & Mocks
- Interfaces
- Inline testing & Facts (Unit tests)
- Constructor methods & public fields 
- Single responsibility principle (SRP) to write functions
- DRY principle (do not repeat yourself)
